We describe the observational con/f_iguration, outline the calibration of the data, and\ndiscuss the effect of radio frequency interference on different observing epochs. In addition, we present a novel\nradio continuum imaging strategy, using well-known baseline subtraction techniques in radio spectral data, and\ndiscuss the applications to the removal of artifacts from sources far from the /f_ield center. Additionally, we discuss\nthe nature of a low-level image-wide offset, the so-called \u201cnegative bowl,\u201d and simulate our observations in order\nthat we may both properly understand and correct for this artifact. Using these techniques, we present the /f_irst\ntotal intensity image of the data which achieves an rms noise of 1.3\u03bcJybeam\n\u22121 with a synthesized beam of\n4.5\u00d7 4.0, the most sensitiveL-band image ever taken at this resolution. We then place this image into the broader\ncontext of 1.4GHz radio continuum surveys in the literature, in terms of image sensitivity and /f_idelity, and\u03bcJy\nlevel source counts andP( D) analysis.\nUni/f_iedAstronomyThesaurusconcepts:Radio interferometry( 1346) ;Radio continuum emission( 1340) ;\nExtragalactic radio sources( 508)\n1.
